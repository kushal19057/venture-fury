💯 Product Description :

We present Venture Fury, an online platform catering to the needs of product founders and investors.
We provide product founders a platform to showcase their ideas by means of image carousels, video footage and engaging text.
By a subscription based model, we allow founders to approach professional mentors for guidance.

Investors are invited to go through the platform along with data driven user engagement metrics to understand the popularity and feasibility of a product.

The general users can register on the platform to follow creators and get live updates on their activities (#PUSH-NOTIFICATIONS), get product recommendations based on past interests (#SEO), chat with product founders (#CHAT), upvote interesting products and be part of this emerging community.

In conclusion, we have built a feature rich and interactive platform catering the needs of both product founders and investors. We hope the community will use our product and come back with constructive comments. Thanks!
